Bachelor Thesis - Data-based surrogate modeling for simulation of blood flow in vessel-like model



Abstract:

While CFD simulations constantly become more complex, data availability also
increases. By exploiting this abundance, modal decomposition and model reduction
techniques exhibit an immense potential to improve hemodynamic research. On
this behalf, this work derives the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method and
examines its capabilities based on a straight vessel-like geometry. Furthermore, as
patient-specific treatment demands fast adaptation and investigation of flow param-
eters, a Navier Stokes equation-based modeling approach is introduced regarding
the vesselâ€™s mass-inflow as a system variable. While calculations show that the
basic DMD algorithm provides quantitatively accurate results, the applied method
of the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) lacks functional outcomes.
Furthermore, different characteristics and variants of the method are demonstrated,
providing a basis for various future assessments and applications.
